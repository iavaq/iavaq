### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent Data Science graduate from Le Wagon London. 

The course was a 10 week full-time intensive coding bootcamp to learn data science with Python. 
 
Most of my projects so far stem from the course. I'm currently working on improving the projects I've worked on, and keeping myself up-to-date through lectures and further lessons on Coursera. In the near future I hope to tackle some challenges on Kaggle.
